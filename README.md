# Regression Analysis Tool
A tool to analyze test result data returned from InfluxDB.

This is a script I took the initiative to write for work in order to analyze test results of new versions of one of our offerings and compare them to the test results from the current production version. Prior to this script, analyzing the results was a manual and tedious process. Incorporating this script into the QA process resulted in faster and more accurate releases.
